	 * ------------ Polymorphism ----------------
	 *  a> method overloading :
	 *      -> use to achieve polymorphism.
	 *      -> we can create multiple methods having same name,return type
	 *         but different list of parameters is known as method overloading.
	 *      
	 *      -> possible form of method.
	 *      
	 *         -> different forms to calculate  area :
	 *          
	 *         * void area(int l, int b){}
	 *         * void area(int r){}
	 *         * void area(int l,int b,int base){}
	 *         * void area(double l){}
	 *      
	 *  b> method overriding :
	 *   
	 *      -> use to achieve run time polymorphism.
	 *      -> there must be IS-A(Inheritance) relationship between classes.
	 *      -> method name,return type and list of arguments same as parent class
	 *         but implementation different in child class is known as method overriding.
	 *
